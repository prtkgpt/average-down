**Title:** I built a free calculator to show exactly how many shares to buy to recover from stock losses

**Body:**
```
I was down 16% on FVRR (bought 10 shares at $19.87, now trading at $16.66). Down $32.

Instead of just holding and hoping, I did the math: if I buy 23 more shares at current price for $383, my average cost drops to $17.50. Now I only need a 6.5% move to break even instead of 16%.

Built a free calculator so anyone can run these scenarios: averagedown.io

Just enter your ticker, shares, avg cost, and current price. You get instant scenarios showing:
- How many shares to buy
- New average cost
- Break-even price
- Price targets for 5% and 10% profit

No signup, no email, completely free. Made it because I couldn't find anything like this.

Fair warning: averaging down increases your position size and risk. Only do this if you'd buy the stock today at current price.

Let me know if this is helpful or if you have suggestions!

**Title:** Turned my -16% loss into a 6.5% recovery play with math [Tool]

**Body:**
```
Down 16% on FVRR like a true regard. Instead of holding bags forever, I calculated the exact number of shares to buy to unfuck my position.

Built this calculator: averagedown.io

Plugged in my numbers:
- 10 shares @ $19.87 avg
- Current price: $16.66
- Currently down: $32 (-16.13%)

Calculator said buy 23 shares for $383 more. New avg: $17.50

Now I only need FVRR to hit $17.75 (+6.5%) instead of $19.87 (+19.2%) to be green.

Free tool, no BS, just math. Works for any ticker.

This is not financial advice. I'm regarded, not a financial advisor.

Positions: 10 FVRR @ $19.87 (soon to be 33 @ $17.50)

I was down 16% on $FVRR 📉

Did the math and realized: buying 23 more shares at current price means I only need a 6.5% move to break even instead of 16%

Built a free calculator so you can run these scenarios too:

### Value Prop Thread

Thread: How to turn your stock losses into profits with math 🧵

1/ Most investors hold losing positions hoping for recovery to their entry price

Example: Bought at $20, now $16. Waiting for +25% move

2/ But there's a better way: strategic averaging down

By buying more shares at lower prices, you lower your average cost

3/ The math:
- 10 shares @ $20 = $200 invested
- Buy 10 more @ $16 = $160 invested
- New average: $18 (not $20)
- Now you only need +12.5% instead of +25%

4/ Built a free calculator to run these scenarios:
averagedown.io

Shows you exactly how many shares to buy at different price targets

5/ Example from today:
$FVRR position: -16.13%
Buy 23 shares → need 6.5% move to break even
Buy 40 shares → need 2.8% move

6/ Important notes:
⚠️ Only average down on stocks you'd buy today
⚠️ This increases your position size and risk
⚠️ Not financial advice, just math

7/ The calculator is free because:
- No signup required
- No paywall
- Supported by ads
- Open to feedback

Try it: averagedown.io

## ProductHunt Launch

**Tagline:** Calculate your path out of stock losses

**Description:**
```
AverageDown.io is a free calculator that shows you exactly how many shares to buy to recover from losing stock positions.

THE PROBLEM
You bought a stock at $20. It's now $16. You're down 20%.

Most investors just hold and hope for a 25% recovery. But there's a better way.

THE SOLUTION
By strategically buying more shares at the lower price, you can lower your average cost and recover faster.

Example:
- Current position: 10 shares @ $20 = $200 invested, down to $160
- Buy 10 more @ $16 = $160 more invested
- New average: $18 (not $20!)
- Now you only need a 12.5% move instead of 25%

FEATURES
✅ Instant calculations - no signup required
✅ Multiple scenarios (break-even, 5% profit, 10% profit)
✅ Shareable calculation links
✅ Works for any ticker
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ 100% free

IMPORTANT NOTES
⚠️ This is not financial advice
⚠️ Only average down on stocks you'd buy today
⚠️ This increases your position size and risk
⚠️ Past performance doesn't indicate future results

Built because I couldn't find a simple tool like this when I needed it. Hope it helps other retail investors make more informed decisions!

- Now only need +12.5% move instead of +25% to break even

Features:

- 100% free (ad-supported)

I built it after being down 16% on FVRR and doing the math myself. Figured other investors could use it.
